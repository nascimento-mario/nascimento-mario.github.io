### Tilt2Score:
This is an Android-based game where the user must control a ball by tilting the phone in order to sink it into the hole. The main (perhaps naive) idea behind the game is to help one train and improve hand-eye coordination.

The game has several levels of increasing difficulty, where the phone becomes more sensitive to the user's movements, the ball slides more easily and other balls stand on the way.

Source code available at [https://github.com/nascimento-mario/Tilt2Score](https://github.com/nascimento-mario/Tilt2Score), and a pre-release Android version ready to installed can be downloaded [here](Artifacts/Tilt2Score-release.apk). *Please note that even though it has been tested by the author, if you choose to install and use it, you'll be doing so at your own risk.*

### SnakeFinger:
This is an browser-based game implementing the classical [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) but the snake is controled by the user's hand gestures, more specifically by the direction they point their fingers. 

The game can be configured by changing the board dimensions, the snake's speed and whether the apple (which the snake should eat) moves or not.

Source code available at [[https://github.com/nascimento-mario/Tilt2Score]([https://github.com/nascimento-mario/SnakeMove](https://github.com/nascimento-mario/SnakeMove). You can also play directly on your browser by pointing it to [here](https://nascimento-mario.github.io/SnakeMove/)](https://nascimento-mario.github.io/SnakeMove/) (just load the URL and play). *Please note that even though the game requires permission to access your webcam, no image is recorded or transmitted anywhere.*
