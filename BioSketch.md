## Biographical Sketch

I have been in academia since 1996 and am currently on semi-retirment mode, i.e., while I do not have a full-time position I do keep collaborating (and visiting) with colleagues.
From most to least recent, I have served as: 
(1) Director of Pacific Northwest Research at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. 
(2) Professor at the University of Alberta’s Department of Computing Science (including a six-year tenure as Department Chair). 
(3) Researcher with the Brazilian Agency for Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) and 
(4) Adjunct faculty member with the Institute of Computing of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Brazil. 
I have also been a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore’s School of Computing, Aalborg University’s Department of Computer Science in Denmark, 
LMU’s Institute for Informatics in Germany and at the Federal University of Ceara in Brazil.

My main research interests have been related spatiotemporal data management and, according to Google Scholar as of Dec/2025, my publications have been cited 5,200+ times, 
yielding an H-index of 34 (DBLP kindly maintains (most of) my publications organized by year).

In terms of academic service I have been General co-Chair for ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024 as well as its Program Committee’s co-Chair in 2022 and 2023. 
I also often served as a program committee member for the main database conferences, as well as (co-)chair of several workshops and symposia. 
I have also served as ACM SIGMOD‘s Information Director (2002-2005), ACM SIGMOD Record‘s Editor-In-Chief (2005-2007) and VLDB Journal‘s Editorial Board member (2011-2017), 
GeoInformatica’s Editorial Board and SSTD Endowment’s Board of Directors (Chair between 2021-2025).
